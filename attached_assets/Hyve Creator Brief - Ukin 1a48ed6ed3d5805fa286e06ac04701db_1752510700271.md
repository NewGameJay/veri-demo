# What is Hyve Labs?

The Hyve Ecosystem and chain is forging a new path bringing games to gamers on any platform with a single wallet/identity, creating an efficient and seamless way for gamers to play and games to be distributed anywhere.

Hyve Studios will be creating their own games and developer partners will build on top of the Hyve chain. The games in 2025 will range from casual plus to some big AAA games. 

<aside>
üëâ

**How Players Get Started**

1. To get started users will (insert video once platform ready) go to [Hyve.gg](http://Hyve.gg) and create a user ID where their Hyve wallet will be created automatically
2. Upon wallet creation, users will mint an Early Access Pass (NFT), which will be revealed at a later date. Although we will currently be on Testnet, all assets will move 1:1 upon Mainnet launch.
    1. The early access pass will have various tiers of rewards and will be revealed at a later date. In February and March we will provide early benefits for users with the pass with exclusive access and rewards as our first games are quickly revealed and released in February through Q2 of 2025. 
3. Prior to the game launching a user can:
    1. Play a hi/lo card minigame everyday to earn XP - what can you run your streak up to?
    2. Complete social quests to earn XP

# Oh Yeah, That‚Äôs Early.

The current gaming landscape is ripe with challenges:

- Fragmentation ‚Äî across chains and tokens creating isolated ecosystems
- Scalability ‚Äî Many chains struggle to grow due to slow transaction speeds, high costs, and data limitations
- Low quality games ‚Äî Games aren't as fun as traditional web2 games
- Accessibility ‚Äî Overly complex onboarding processes that require technical knowledge and limit user adoption
- Discoverability ‚Äî walled gardens created by app/game stores make distribution a challenge

**The Hyve Solution**

The Hyve ecosystem lets a user play across platforms without limits ‚Äì no app stores, no fees and no walled gardens. Play games anywhere with anyone through simple onboarding via your browser and social media platforms.

- Seamless onboarding
- On-chain transactions - EVM
- On-chain liveops tools
- Data Availability layer for deep segmentation
- Friends, Factions and the ability to chat
