## üìä Josh's Specific Feedback Points

### VeriScore Clarification
> "For your VeriScore, we were still thinking of like a one to one hundred scale or something similar, one to one thousand scale or one to ten thousand scale of the perfect creator. And then the XP is something that just continuously goes up. Whereas your VeriScore is something that determines your resonance as a creator and your resonance as content."

### Task Design Philosophy
> "I feel like that's pretty clean... Kind of like quest things in a video game."

### AI Interface Vision
> "I think it'd be really cool if we had a chatbot kind of... If somebody was just looking for something, they just wanted to text their agent within Veri, they could absolutely do that."

### Profile Sharing Importance
> "I think that's one of the biggest things that we were talking about is being able to share... an actual showcase of your profile."

### Leaderboard Integration
> "Would love to see, like, top three or something here. Or, like, where you are in leaderboard. Or maybe just, like, your profile here. And where you are in leaderboard."

## üìù Notes for Replit Implementation

When implementing these SOPs in Replit:
1. Reference the existing component files mentioned in earlier sprints
2. Build on current functionality - don't recreate from scratch
3. Use the established design system tokens
4. Maintain the glass morphism and animation standards
5. Test each enhancement incrementally

Remember: This sprint enhances Josh's experience concerns while respecting Matt's design vision. Every change should feel like a natural evolution of the existing MVP.
