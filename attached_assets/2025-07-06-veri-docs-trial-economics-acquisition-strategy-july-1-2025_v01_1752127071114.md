# Trial Economics + Acquisition Strategy (July 1, 2025)
### The "$2 Moment" Definition
**$2 moment** = creator cashout validation proving "this platform actually pays me" (unlike matera) **Point economy:** Brand campaign tasks → points earned → creator choice: **cash out** OR **spend on tools**
### Real Creator Economics (Based on Hyve Campaign Data)
**Hyve Campaign Analysis:**
* **5 creators paid** $2,000-$3,000 each over 3 months
* **Performance range:** 709-2,706 avg impressions per post
* **CPM range:** $43-$343 (avg $179)
* **Post frequency:** 9-17 posts per creator per campaign
* **Platforms:** Twitter dominant, TikTok highest engagement (11.45%)

⠀Veri Creator Tier Strategy (Grounded in Real Data)
| Creator Tier | Follower Range | Expected Performance | Twitter Post Rate | TikTok/YT Rate | Multi-Post Campaign |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Micro | 1k-10k | 200-800 impressions | $50-150 | $100-250 | $500-1,500 |
| Mid | 10k-100k | 800-2,000 impressions | $150-400 | $250-600 | $1,500-4,000 |
| Macro | 100k+ | 2,000+ impressions | $400-1,000 | $600-1,500 | $4,000-10,000 |
*Based on Hyve CPM range of $43-$343, targeting $50-200 CPM for competitive positioning*
### Campaign Budget Distribution (25% Platform Margin)
| Campaign Budget | Platform Fee (25%) | Creator Allocation (75%) | Micro Tasks | Mid Tasks | Macro Tasks |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| $1,000 | $250 | $750 | 5-15 posts | 2-5 posts | 1 post |
| $2,500 | $625 | $1,875 | 10-35 posts | 5-12 posts | 2-5 posts |
| $5,000 | $1,250 | $3,750 | 20-75 posts | 10-25 posts | 4-9 posts |
| $10,000 | $2,500 | $7,500 | 40-150 posts | 20-50 posts | 8-18 posts |
### Point Economics (The Key to Profitability)
**Point exchange mechanics by cashout rate:**
**Micro creator ($100 Twitter post = 10,000 points):**
* **30% cashout:** 10,000 points = $30 cash OR 160 tool uses ($10 cost) = **$20 platform savings**
* **40% cashout:** 10,000 points = $40 cash OR 160 tool uses ($10 cost) = **$30 platform savings**
* **50% cashout:** 10,000 points = $50 cash OR 160 tool uses ($10 cost) = **$40 platform savings**

⠀**Mid creator ($300 multi-platform post = 30,000 points):**
* **30% cashout:** 30,000 points = $90 cash OR 480 tool uses ($30 cost) = **$60 platform savings**
* **40% cashout:** 30,000 points = $120 cash OR 480 tool uses ($30 cost) = **$90 platform savings**
* **50% cashout:** 30,000 points = $150 cash OR 480 tool uses ($30 cost) = **$120 platform savings**

⠀**Macro creator ($800 campaign = 80,000 points):**
* **30% cashout:** 80,000 points = $240 cash OR 1,280 tool uses ($80 cost) = **$160 platform savings**
* **40% cashout:** 80,000 points = $320 cash OR 1,280 tool uses ($80 cost) = **$240 platform savings**
* **50% cashout:** 80,000 points = $400 cash OR 1,280 tool uses ($80 cost) = **$320 platform savings**

⠀Campaign Profitability by Cashout Rate (70% Tool Usage)
| Campaign Budget | Platform Fee | 30% Cashout Rate | 40% Cashout Rate | 50% Cashout Rate |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| $1,000 | $250 | +$147 profit | +$117 profit | +$87 profit |
| $2,500 | $625 | +$368 profit | +$293 profit | +$218 profit |
| $5,000 | $1,250 | +$737 profit | +$587 profit | +$437 profit |
| $10,000 | $2,500 | +$1,475 profit | +$1,175 profit | +$875 profit |
### Web3 Creator Cashout Rate Rationale
**Why Lower Rates Work for Web3 Creators:**
* **Gas fee reality:** $10-50+ costs to move/sell tokens make small cashouts pointless
* **DEX economics:** 30-70% effective exchange rates common due to slippage + liquidity issues
* **Platform norms:** Most web3 gaming platforms offer 0% cashout or require massive token holdings
* **Utility mindset:** Web3 creators expect tokens to be more valuable within ecosystem than extracted
* **Reinvestment culture:** "Diamond hands" mentality = prefer platform growth over small cash extractions

⠀**Traditional Platform Comparison:**
* **YouTube:** Takes 45% of creator ad revenue
* **Twitch:** Takes 50% of subscription revenue
* **Web3 gaming:** Often 0% real cashout opportunity
* **Gaming tokens:** Frequently 30-70% real exchange rate losses

⠀**Competitive Positioning:**
* **30% rate:** Ultra-competitive vs web3 norms, maximizes platform margins
* **40% rate:** Above-market generous, strong unit economics
* **50% rate:** Premium positioning, creator-friendly but lower margins

⠀**Strategic Recommendation:** Start with 40% cashout rate - significantly better than web3 norms while maintaining strong unit economics. Can adjust based on creator feedback and competitive dynamics.
