## 📋 Sprint 4 Tasks

### Sprint 4.1: Task vs Campaign Architecture Refactor (P0 - 4-5 hours)

#### Copy This Exact Prompt to Replit:
```
REFACTOR the existing task system to clearly differentiate Tasks vs Campaigns:

TASK REDEFINITION (micro-actions):
- Retweet brand content
- Share blog posts to IG Stories  
- Reformat content for different platforms
- Quick social engagement actions (like, comment, share)
- Keep existing task card design but update content examples

CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE (higher-tier locked content):
- Gaming highlight reels
- Full video deliverables
- Multi-platform content campaigns
- Brand partnership executions
- MUST be locked until streak requirements met (like AI agent)

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Add toggle tabs at top of tasks page: "Tasks | Campaigns"
2. Tasks tab shows micro-actions (current functionality)
3. Campaigns tab shows locked premium content with:
   - Lock icon overlay (same as AI agent tool)
   - "Complete 7-day streak to unlock" messaging
   - Preview of campaign types available
   - Use existing glass morphism locked state styling

CRITICAL: Campaigns should feel like premium content worth unlocking through consistent engagement. Reference the AI agent locked state for visual consistency.
```

#### Test & Verify:
- [ ] Toggle tabs switch between Tasks and Campaigns views
- [ ] Tasks show micro-actions with quick completion
- [ ] Campaigns display locked state until streak met
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clearly differentiates the two types
- [ ] Streak requirements clearly communicated

#### Expected Results:
✅ Clear differentiation between tasks and campaigns  
✅ Gamified progression system with locked content  
✅ Increased user engagement through streak mechanics  
✅ Premium feel for campaign content

### Sprint 4.2: Profile Builder Visual Interface Implementation (P0 - 3-4 hours)

#### Copy This Exact Prompt to Replit:
```
REPLACE the current profile builder with Matt's visual interface from Figma:

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Remove current text-based profile builder
- Implement visual profile selection interface
- Use card-based layout for profile type selection
- Include gaming creator personas and studio profiles
- Maintain existing navigation and flow structure

VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:
1. Profile type cards should include:
   - Icon or avatar representation
   - Profile type name (Gaming Creator, Studio, etc.)
   - Brief description of each type
   - Hover effects using existing glass morphism
   - Click to select functionality

2. After selection, flow to appropriate profile editor:
   - Gaming creators → Creator profile builder
   - Studios → Studio profile builder
   - Keep existing form fields but improve visual hierarchy

REFERENCE: Use Matt's Figma designs as the single source of truth for visual implementation. The current functionality works - just needs visual upgrade to match design specs.
```

#### Test & Verify:
- [ ] Profile selection uses visual cards not text
- [ ] Each profile type clearly differentiated
- [ ] Selection flows to appropriate builder
- [ ] Visual design matches Figma specifications
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved

#### Expected Results:
✅ Professional visual profile selection  
✅ Clear user journey from selection to completion  
✅ Consistent with Matt's design vision  
✅ Improved user experience
