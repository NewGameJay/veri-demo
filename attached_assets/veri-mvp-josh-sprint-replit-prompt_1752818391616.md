IMPLEMENT Josh's critical feedback from Loom review videos - 5 SEQUENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS:

CONTEXT: Josh reviewed our Veri MVP and provided specific feedback. Matt's design remains the authority, but we need to enhance functionality per Josh's requests. Build on existing components - DO NOT recreate from scratch.
