markdown# Veri Hybrid Stack - Project Summary

## what we built
comprehensive technical architecture for veri's creator monetization platform with dual-path implementation strategy:

**1. signal engine architecture** - memory-driven intelligence platform that treats creator data as persistent memory rather than disposable analytics, enabling compound learning across the network

**2. baseline mvp stack** - lightweight postgres + redpanda implementation for rapid launch (≤1 week demo, <$100/mo infrastructure)

**3. hybrid migration framework** - seamless transition path from baseline to full signal engine via feature flags and interface abstractions

## what veri does
monetization infrastructure for performance-based creator marketing:
- **creator toolkit** → oauth insights + ai agents (free, subsidized by brand spend)
- **brand toolkit** → campaign briefs + roi analytics (saas revenue model)
- **signal engine** → persistent memory that improves recommendations through compound learning

## key technical decisions

### architecture approach
baseline mvp (postgres + redpanda) → dual-write bridge → atlas primary (mongo + vector search)

### feature flag design
- `USE_MONGO=false` → single-write postgres (default)
- `USE_MONGO=true` → dual-write mode  
- `READ_FROM_MONGO=true` → mongo primary reads

### interface abstractions
```typescript
StorageInterface → PostgresAdapter | MongoAdapter
SearchInterface → SQLSearch | HybridSearch  
MemoryInterface → BasicMemory | IntelligentMemory
implementation phases
phase a (week 1) - baseline foundation

postgres + redpanda + oauth + basic chat working
exit: end-to-end demo, ≤2s latency, <$100/mo cost

phase b (week 2) - dual-write infrastructure

storage interfaces + mongo adapters + parity monitoring
exit: 99%+ dual-write integrity, <200ms performance delta

phase c (week 3) - signal engine capabilities

hybrid search + memory formation + intelligent decay
exit: semantic search working, measurable signal improvements

phase d (week 4) - migration + optimization

read cutover + performance tuning + monitoring dashboard
exit: mongo primary reads, <$3.30/creator cost, full observability

frameworks built

connection management → abstract factory with postgres/mongo adapters
cache layer → redis wrapper with ttl + batch operations
security → oauth state + webhook validation + rate limiting
observability → metrics collection + alerting + cost tracking
business process → workflow templates + campaign automation

success metrics

technical → ≤1s chat latency, 99%+ dual-write parity, <$3.30/creator monthly cost
business → 50%+ roi prediction accuracy, 35%+ 7-day creator retention, 25%+ campaign success lift

competitive advantage
memory-driven architecture creates compound learning - each creator's success improves recommendations for all similar creators, building defensible moats through accumulated intelligence that traditional platforms cannot replicate.
deliverables created

comprehensive architecture doc → full signal engine + baseline + comparative analysis
hybrid implementation guide → complete technical specs + repo structure + deployment pipeline

next steps

replit deployment → baseline stack running + validated
brand onboarding → first 3 studios with $5k+ escrow by aug 15
dual-write implementation → seamless bridge to signal engine capabilities
mvp launch → public demo + creator cohort by aug 31

**for replit handoff:**

yes, you'd give them:
1. **this readme** (project context + summary)
2. **comprehensive architecture doc** (full technical + business strategy)  
3. **hybrid implementation guide** (complete build specifications)

**that's it.** the implementation guide contains the complete repo structure, every file/directory mapped, runtime commands, env variables, deployment scripts - everything needed to build the stack.

the only additional thing replit might need is **access to your actual API keys** when they're ready to deploy (claude, oauth credentials, etc), but the docs show them exactly what keys they need + where they go.
