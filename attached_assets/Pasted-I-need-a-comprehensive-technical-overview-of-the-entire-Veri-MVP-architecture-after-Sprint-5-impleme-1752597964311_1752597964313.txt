I need a comprehensive technical overview of the entire Veri MVP architecture after Sprint 5 implementation. Please provide a detailed analysis covering ALL components - both the existing features from earlier sprints AND the new Signal Engine/Brightmatter architecture we just added.
Please organize your response into these sections:
1. Complete Architecture Map
Show the full system architecture including:

Frontend components and their relationships
Backend services (active and dormant)
Database layers (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Vector Store)
Event streaming infrastructure (Redpanda/Kafka)
AI/ML components (Brightmatter, Signal Engine)
External integrations (Social APIs, MCP connectors)

2. Frontend State Analysis

Current UI/UX components status
Glass morphism design system implementation
Dashboard functionality (what works vs what's placeholder)
Authentication flow status
Profile builder integration
Settings pages including new Veri Connectors module

3. Backend Infrastructure Status
Break down by service:
Active Services:

PostgreSQL database (schema, tables, relationships)
JWT authentication system
API endpoints currently functional
Web3 wallet integration status

Dormant Services (Built but Disabled):

Memorriz Memory Intelligence Layer
Vector Store (ChromaDB) integration
MCP Tools Framework (Google Drive, Slack, Notion, Custom)
Enhanced Signal Engine components
Event streaming (Redpanda/Kafka)
Redis caching layer
MongoDB for signal storage

4. API Endpoints Inventory
List all API routes with their status:

/api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
/api/users/* - User management
/api/tasks/* - Task system
/api/campaigns/* - Campaign management
/api/brightmatter/* - AI/Signal Engine endpoints
/api/mcp/* - MCP connector endpoints
Any other endpoints

5. Signal Engine Architecture Details
For each component, show:

File location
Purpose and functionality
Dependencies
Mock data vs real implementation status
Required environment variables

Components to cover:

Memorriz Core (memory management)
Context Manager (session handling)
Semantic Index (vector search)
Memory Pruning (optimization)
Signal Processing (engagement, viral, safety)
VeriScore Calculator (6-factor algorithm)
AI Content Optimizer
Analytics Engine

6. Integration Points
Map out all integration points:

Social platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram)
AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic)
Vector stores (Chroma, embeddings)
MCP connectors (what each connects to)
Blockchain/Web3 preparations

7. Environment Configuration
List ALL environment variables:

Currently configured (with current values if not sensitive)
Required but not set (with descriptions)
Feature flags and their current states

8. Docker Services
Show docker-compose.yml services:

Running services
Optional services (with 'profiles: optional')
Service dependencies
Port mappings

9. Development Tools & Scripts
List all available scripts and tools:

npm scripts for validation
Test data generators
Architecture checkers
Integration testers
Mock data systems

10. Activation Readiness Checklist
For each dormant service, specify:

What's needed to activate it
Dependencies that must be activated first
API keys required
Configuration steps
Potential issues to watch for

11. Technical Debt & Known Issues

Authentication session persistence status
Build timeout issues
Any integration gaps
Performance concerns
Security considerations

12. Next Steps Recommendations
Based on current state:

What should be activated first
Critical fixes needed
Performance optimizations available
Security hardening required

Please be extremely detailed and include file paths, code snippets where relevant, and clear indicators of what's real vs mock implementation. I need to understand exactly what we have built and what remains to be connected.
