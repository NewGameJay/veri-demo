# Replit Sprint 4 Execution Prompt

I have a Sprint 4 Implementation Guide (Veri MVP Sprint 4 Implementation Guide.md) that contains 7 development tasks. I need you to:

## Execution Process:

1. **Read and understand** the entire Sprint 4 Implementation Guide
2. **Execute each sprint task** in order (4.1 through 4.7)
3. **After completing each task:**
   - Show me visual proof of the implementation (screenshots or describe what changed)
   - Run the test checklist from the "Test & Verify" section
   - Tell me the test results (✅ pass or ❌ fail for each item)
   - Provide specific instructions on how I can verify the changes myself
   - Ask: "Task 4.X complete. Here's what I implemented: [summary]. Would you like to test this yourself or make any adjustments before I proceed to Task 4.X+1?"

## Specific Requirements:

### For Each Task Completion:
1. **Visual Evidence**: Show before/after screenshots or describe the visual changes
2. **Test Results**:
Sprint 4.1 Test Results: ✅ Toggle tabs switch between Tasks and Campaigns views ✅ Tasks show micro-actions with quick completion
❌ Campaigns display locked state until streak met (issue: lock icon not showing) ✅ Visual hierarchy clearly differentiates the two types ✅ Streak requirements clearly communicated

3. **Verification Instructions**:
To verify on your end:
    •    Navigate to the Tasks page
    •    Click the new "Campaigns" tab
    •    Check that campaigns show as locked with overlay
    •    Complete a 7-day streak and verify unlock
    •    Test on mobile to ensure responsive design

4. **Wait for my confirmation** before proceeding to the next task

## Priority Order:
- Complete all P0 tasks first (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)
- Then move to P1 tasks (4.5, 4.6, 4.7)
- Reference Sprint 3 work and maintain consistency with existing styles

## Important Notes:
- Matt's design decisions are final - if anything conflicts, follow Matt's vision
- Don't rebuild working features - enhance and fix only
- Keep all existing glass morphism effects and animations
- Test each implementation thoroughly before showing results

Start with Sprint 4.1 (Task vs Campaign Architecture Refactor) and show me the results.
