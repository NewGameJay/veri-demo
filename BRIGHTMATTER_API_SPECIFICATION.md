# Brightmatter API Specification
## AI Intelligence Layer for Veri Creator Platform

**Generated**: August 1, 2025  
**Version**: v1.0  
**Purpose**: Complete API specification for Brightmatter's three-agent intelligence system  

---

## Executive Summary

Brightmatter operates as Veri's sophisticated AI backbone, delivering the "butterflies moment" that creators experience when they first interact with a truly intelligent system that understands their unique context without manual setup. Unlike generic AI tools that require months of fine-tuning, Brightmatter activates immediately upon OAuth signup with three specialized agents working in concert to create an insurmountable competitive moat.

### The Three-Agent Architecture

**OAuth Agent**: Automatically ingests comprehensive creator data from all connected social channels - YouTube Studio reports, analytics, performance metrics, audience demographics, engagement patterns, and revenue streams.

**Research Agent**: Leverages Brave Search Pro AI tier and Google Trends APIs to analyze the creator's niche landscape, competitive positioning, market opportunities, and trending content within their specific vertical.

**Insight Agent**: Synthesizes OAuth and research data to generate dynamic VeriScores while surfacing actionable intelligence for improving audience resonance, content strategy, and monetization opportunities.

This architecture enables compound learning across the entire creator ecosystem - as more creators engage with Veri, every individual creator's insights become richer through GraphRAG semantic search and vector storage, without exposing personal data or competitive intelligence.

### Strategic Value Proposition

New Game Interactive's BHAG positions Veri/Brightmatter as the most intelligent creator ecosystem where compound learning creates an insurmountable moat. Brands will pay premium rates for campaign placement and SaaS access to this unmatched creator intelligence layer that no competitor can replicate once critical mass is achieved.
