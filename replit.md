## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: Express server with TypeScript compilation
- **Database**: In-memory storage for MVP, PostgreSQL for production

### Production Deployment
- **Frontend**: Static build deployed to Vercel or similar
- **Backend**: Node.js server on Railway or similar platform
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Environment**: Separate staging and production environments

### Build Process
- `npm run dev`: Development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build`: Production build with Vite bundling and esbuild compilation
- `npm run start`: Production server startup
- `npm run db:push`: Database schema synchronization

The application is designed to scale from MVP to full marketplace functionality, with the current implementation focusing on core creator onboarding, social connections, and gamification features.
