- Task verification system with social platform validation
- Profile builder for creators and studios
- Memorizz repository integration for AI-powered memory-driven intelligence
- Enhanced Apple-like glass morphism design with smooth animations
- Brand assets implementation (actual Veri logo, Termina Bold typography, brand colors)
- Dynamic user info display in header with real XP points and user data
- Animated social connections with brand-aligned platform icons
- Mobile-first responsive design with Lottie-style effects
- PostgreSQL database integration for persistent data storage
- Full social media platform connection functionality
- Enhanced hamburger menu with auto-collapse, pin functionality, and collapsible sidebar with icon-only mode

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
